# Sequences and Memory in Neural Networks
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Sequential Data Fundamentals

Sequential data exhibits temporal dependencies where past influences future.

Time series contain measurements at regular intervals tracking changes.

Natural language is sequential information processed word by word.

Sequences have variable length requiring special handling in models.

Positional information matters different meanings at different positions.

Memory retention enables learning long-term dependencies.

## Feedforward Limitations

Standard feedforward networks lack memory between inputs.

No temporal context captured from previous inputs.

Fixed input size incompatible with variable length sequences.

No sharing of parameters across time steps.

Markovian assumption ignores historical information.

Cannot model temporal dynamics effectively.

## Memory Architectures

Hidden state maintains information across time steps.
