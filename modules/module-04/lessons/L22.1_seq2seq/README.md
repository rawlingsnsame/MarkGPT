# Sequence-to-Sequence Models
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Seq2Seq Framework

Sequence-to-sequence models map input sequences to outputs.

Encoder RNN processes input sequence to fixed representation.

Context vector summarizes entire input in fixed dimension.

Decoder RNN generates output sequence from context.

Separate encoder and decoder enable asymmetric processing.

Applicable to translation, summarization, question answering.

## Encoder-Decoder Pattern

Encoder compresses variable length input to fixed size.

Final hidden state becomes context for decoder.

Decoder starts with context vector as initial state.

Decoder generates outputs one timestep at a time.

Teacher forcing provides ground truth during training.

Beam search explores multiple hypotheses at inference.

## Training Considerations

Encoder fully processes input before decoder starts.

Context vector is bottleneck for information transfer.

Limited context causes loss of important information.

Attention mechanisms mitigate context bottleneck.

Different encoding and decoding vocabulary possible.
