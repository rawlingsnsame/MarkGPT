## Recurrent Neural Networks - Fundamentals

### What is a Recurrent Network?

Standard feedforward: x → h → output
Recurrent: x_t → h_t → output_t
h_t depends on x_t AND h_{t-1}
Hidden state carries information from past.

Processing sequences: One element at a time
Weights shared across time steps (parameter efficiency).
### Hidden State and Time Unrolling

h_t = tanh(W_h @ h_{t-1} + W_x @ x_t + b)
o_t = W_o @ h_t + b_o

Time unrolling: Unfold RNN for T time steps
Creates deep feedforward network (depth = sequence length)
Backprop through time (BPTT): Chain rule across time.

## Sequence to Output

### Many-to-One (e.g., sentiment)

Input: Sequence of 100 words
Process: Apply RNN at each step
Output: Only use final h_T for classification
Loss computes only on last output.
Gradient flows backward through all steps.

### One-to-Many (e.g., image captioning)

Input: Single image
Process: Encode to h_0
Output: Generate caption word by word
h_0 from CNN → fed to RNN
Each RNN step outputs word token.

### Many-to-Many (e.g., NER, machine translation)

Input: Sequence of N tokens
Process: RNN processes all
Output: Sequence of N predictions
Each time step has input and output.
Examples: Sequence labeling, translation.

## The Vanishing Gradient Problem

### The Issue

BPTT: Chain rule multiplies gradients
∂L/∂h_0 = (∂L/∂h_T) * (∂h_T/∂h_{T-1}) * ... * (∂h_1/∂h_0)
Each ∂h_t/∂h_{t-1} < 1 typically
Product of T < 1 terms → exponentially small
Gradient for h_0 becomes nearly 0.

### Why This Matters

Early inputs get negligible gradients.
Model forgets distant past (effective window ~5-20 steps).
Long-range dependencies can't be learned.
Example: Pronoun in position 1, reference at position 50.
RNN unlikely to learn this dependency.

### Exploding Gradients (Opposite Problem)

If ∂h_t/∂h_{t-1} > 1:
Product of T > 1 terms → exponentially large
Gradients overflow to NaN/Inf
Training becomes unstable.
Less common than vanishing but worse when it happens.

## Solutions: Gradient Clipping

### The Fix

Gradient norm clipping:
if ||∇|| > threshold:
  ∇ = ∇ * (threshold / ||∇||)
Rescales large gradients.
Prevents explosion.
Threshold: 1.0 or 5.0 typical.

### Implementation

Compute gradients as usual.
Compute L2 norm: sqrt(sum of g^2).
If norm > max_norm: rescale.
Apply update.
Handles both explosion and (partially) vanishing.

## Solutions: Better Activation Functions

### ReLU in RNNs

tanh: Saturates, derivative → 0
ReLU: Linear on positive side, derivative = 1
Helps gradients flow better.
But can have dying ReLU problem.
ELU/GELU: Smooth, no saturation.

## Simple RNN Implementation

### Core Loop

```python
class SimpleRNN:
  def forward(self, X):  # X: (T, batch, input_dim)
    h = zeros((batch, hidden_dim))
    outputs = []
    for t in range(T):
      h = tanh(X[t] @ Wx + h @ Wh + bh)
      out = h @ Wo + bo
      outputs.append(out)
    return stack(outputs)
```

### Backpropagation Through Time

```python
def backward(self, grad_output):  # (T, batch, out_dim)
  dWx, dWh, dWo = 0, 0, 0
  dh_next = 0
  for t in reversed(range(T)):
    dh = (grad_output[t] @ Wo.T + dh_next)
    dWo += h[t].T @ grad_output[t]
    dh = dh * (1 - h[t]**2)  # tanh derivative
    dWx += X[t].T @ dh
    dWh += h[t-1].T @ dh
    dh_next = dh @ Wh.T
```

## Truncated Backpropagation

### Motivation

Full BPTT through entire sequence → slow
Backprop only through last k steps
Practical compromise: Efficient + reasonably good
k values: 20-50 steps typical
Still captures local temporal dependencies.

## Weight Initialization

### Why It Matters

Poor init: Gradients vanish/explode from start
Good init: Preserve signal variance across layers
Key: Keep ||h_t|| roughly constant
Var(h_t) ≈ Var(h_{t-1})

### Orthogonal Initialization

Initialize Wh as orthogonal matrix
Properties: Preserves vector norm
Eigenvalues = 1 (no growth/decay)
Prevents gradient explosion/vanishing initially.
Recommended for RNNs.

## Bidirectional RNNs

### Motivation

Forward RNN: Process left to right
Backward RNN: Process right to left
Concatenate outputs: [h_fwd; h_bwd]
Access context from both directions.
Improves performance on tagging tasks.

### Architecture

Input sequence: [w1, w2, w3, w4]
Forward pass: → → → →
Backward pass: ← ← ← ←
Output at t: [fwd_h_t; bwd_h_t]
Dimension: 2 * hidden_dim

## Peephole Connections

### With RNN

Standard: h_t = f(W @ [x_t; h_{t-1}])
No dependency on cell state (in basic RNN).
Gradient flow during forward pass constrained.

## Sequence Padding and Masking

### Variable Length Sequences

Real sequences: Different lengths
Batch processing: Need same length
Solution: Pad short sequences
Padding token: 0 (special index)
Sequence lengths: Store actual lengths

### Masking

During forward: Process padded positions
During loss: Ignore padded positions
Loss = sum(loss[i] * mask[i]) / sum(mask)
Prevents gradients from padding tokens.
Attention:  Mask with -inf (softmax → 0).
