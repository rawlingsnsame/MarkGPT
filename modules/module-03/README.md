# Module 03 — Neural Networks from Scratch
## Days 13–18 | Intermediate

---

## Module Overview

This module builds your intuition for how neural networks learn. You will implement a neuron, then a multi-layer perceptron, then the magic of backpropagation — all from scratch, in plain Python and NumPy.

By the end of Module 03, you will:
- Understand the neuron as a mathematical object
- Implement forward and backward passes
- Solve non-linear problems (XOR) that n-gram models cannot
- Grasp why depth matters in neural networks

## Neuron Architecture and Fundamentals

### The Biological Perspective

Artificial neurons are inspired by biological neurons:
- **Dendrites**: Receive signals (inputs)
- **Cell Body**: Process information (weighted sum)
- **Axon**: Send output signal
- **Synapse**: Connection strength (weights)

**Firing Mechanism**
Biological neuron fires when activation exceeds threshold.
Artificial neuron: Apply activation function to weighted sum.

### Mathematical Definition of a Neuron

**Linear Combination**
$$z = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + ... + w_n x_n + b$$

Where:
- $x_i$: Input features
- $w_i$: Weights (synaptic strengths)
- $b$: Bias (threshold shift)
- $z$: Pre-activation (logit)

**Activation**
$$a = \sigma(z)$$

Where $\sigma$ is activation function (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, etc.)

### Activation Functions Deep Dive

**Sigmoid Function**
$$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$
- Output: (0, 1)
- Smooth gradient
- Vanishing gradient problem

```python
def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

def sigmoid_derivative(z):
    s = sigmoid(z)
    return s * (1 - s)
```

**Hyperbolic Tangent**
$$\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}$$
- Output: (-1, 1)
- Centered at zero
- Also has vanishing gradient issue

### ReLU and Modern Activations

**Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**
$$f(z) = \max(0, z)$$
- Advantages:
  - Simple computation
  - No vanishing gradient for positive values
  - Speeds up convergence
- Disadvantages:
  - Dying ReLU (zero output for negative inputs)
  - Not smooth at z=0

```python
def relu(z):
    return np.maximum(0, z)

def relu_derivative(z):
    return (z > 0).astype(float)
```

**Leaky ReLU**
$$f(z) = \max(\alpha z, z)$$
- $\alpha$ small (0.01): Allows small negative gradient
- Prevents dying ReLU

**ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)**
$$f(z) = \begin{cases} z & \text{if } z > 0 \\ \alpha(e^z - 1) & \text{if } z \leq 0 \end{cases}$$
- Closer to zero-mean outputs
- Smoother near origin
