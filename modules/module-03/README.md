# Module 03 — Neural Networks from Scratch
## Days 13–18 | Intermediate

---

## Module Overview

This module builds your intuition for how neural networks learn. You will implement a neuron, then a multi-layer perceptron, then the magic of backpropagation — all from scratch, in plain Python and NumPy.

By the end of Module 03, you will:
- Understand the neuron as a mathematical object
- Implement forward and backward passes
- Solve non-linear problems (XOR) that n-gram models cannot
- Grasp why depth matters in neural networks

## Learning Objectives

## Neuron Architecture and Fundamentals

### The Biological Perspective

Artificial neurons are inspired by biological neurons:
- **Dendrites**: Receive signals (inputs)
- **Cell Body**: Process information (weighted sum)
- **Axon**: Send output signal
- **Synapse**: Connection strength (weights)

**Firing Mechanism**
Biological neuron fires when activation exceeds threshold.
Artificial neuron: Apply activation function to weighted sum.
