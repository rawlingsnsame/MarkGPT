# Dropout and Batch Normalization
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Dropout Mechanism

Dropout randomly disables neurons during training.

Each neuron kept with probability p during forward pass.

Prevents co-adaptation of features.

Acts as ensemble of thinned networks.

No dropout applied during inference.

Scaling ensures same expected output at inference.

## Dropout Variants

Standard dropout drops neurons independently.

Spatial dropout drops feature maps in convolutional layers.

Variational dropout shares dropout mask across timesteps.
