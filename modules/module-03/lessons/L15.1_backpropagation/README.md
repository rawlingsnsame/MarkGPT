## The Chain Rule in Networks

Backpropagation applies the chain rule to compute gradients.

Gradients flow backward from outputs to model parameters.

Each layer propagates error signals to previous layers.

The chain rule decomposes complex derivatives into simple parts.

Automatic differentiation implements the chain rule efficiently.

Understanding backpropagation reveals how networks learn.

## Forward and Backward Pass

The forward pass computes outputs from inputs through layers.

Intermediate activations are stored for backward computation.

The backward pass computes gradients of loss w.r.t. parameters.

Gradients enable parameter updates toward lower loss.

Forward pass cost is one inference, backward is ~2x inference.

Efficient computation critical for training large networks.

## Gradient Flow and Backpropagation Challenges

Vanishing gradients occur when gradients shrink through layers.

Exploding gradients occur when gradients grow exponentially.

Gradient clipping prevents explosion by capping gradient norms.

Careful initialization helps maintain stable gradient flow.

Batch normalization stabilizes gradient flow through networks.

Skip connections (residual networks) enable training very deep.
