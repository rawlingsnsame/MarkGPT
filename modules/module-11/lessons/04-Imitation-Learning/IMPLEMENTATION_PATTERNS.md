# Implementation Patterns for Lesson 4

## Pattern 1: Setup and Initialization
```
Initialize environment
Configure network architecture  
Setup optimizer with learning rate
Initialize replay buffer or policy
```

## Pattern 2: Training Loop
```
for episode in episodes:
    state = env.reset()
    for step in steps:
        action = policy(state)
        reward, next_state = env.step(action)
        store(state, action, reward, next_state)
        update(batch_sample())
```

## Pattern 3: Evaluation
```
Run policy on test environments
Measure cumulative reward
Record success rate
Compare to baseline
```

## Pattern 4: Hyperparameter Tuning
- Learning rate: 1e-4 to 1e-2
- Batch size: 32 to 256  
- Update frequency: every 1-10 steps
- Discount factor: 0.9 to 0.999

## Pattern 5: Debugging
- Log every 100 steps
- Visualize once per episode
- Check gradients for NaN
- Monitor memory usage

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't forget to normalize observations
- Always use gradient clipping
- Store metrics for analysis
- Test on simple environments first
