# Gradient Descent and Optimization
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Gradient Descent Variants

Batch gradient descent computes gradients using all training data then updates once.

Stochastic gradient descent updates weights after each sample with noisy updates.

Mini-batch gradient descent balances stability and speed using small batches.

Learning rate scheduling adjusts step size during training for optimal convergence.

## Adaptive Learning Rate Methods

Adagrad adapts learning rates per parameter based on historical gradients.

RMSprop addresses Adagrad's problem using weighted average of squared gradients.

Adam combines momentum and RMSprop for faster convergence in practice.

Adaptive methods have trade-offs between convergence speed and generalization.

## Convergence and Debugging

Convergence curves plot training progress showing loss or accuracy versus epochs.

Exploding and vanishing gradients plague deep networks requiring solutions.

Gradient clipping, batch normalization, and skip connections solve gradient flow.

Hyperparameter tuning optimizes learning rate, batch size, and regularization.


## Advanced Optimization Algorithms

Coordinate descent optimizes one variable at a time.

Frank-Wolfe algorithms handle structured constraints.

Proximal gradient methods combine gradients with proximity operators.
