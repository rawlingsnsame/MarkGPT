# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Fundamentals

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible. PCA finds orthogonal directions (principal components) that capture maximum variance in the data. Applications include visualization of high-dimensional data, noise reduction, and preprocessing for other algorithms. PCA is unsupervised and doesn't consider target labels, making it purely exploratory.

## Key Concepts

- **Principal Components**: Eigenvectors of covariance matrix
- **Explained Variance**: Proportion of variance retained
- **Scree Plot**: Variance by component
- **Cumulative Variance**: Total variance explained

### Dimensionality Reduction and Variance Maximization

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction technique that identifies new features (principal components) that capture maximum variance in the data. The first principal component is the direction of maximum variance; the second principal component is orthogonal to the first and captures the second-most variance; and so on. These directions are eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix, ordered by descending eigenvalues (which represent variance along each direction). By selecting the top k principal components, we project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional subspace while retaining as much variance as possible. This variance-maximizing property ensures that important structure in data is preserved while removing noise and redundancy. PCA is unsupervised in that it does not use class labels; it discovers structure purely from feature correlations.

### Computational Implementation and Interpretation

Concretely, PCA involves computing the covariance matrix C = 1/n · X^T·X where X is the centered data matrix. The eigendecomposition of C yields eigenvectors (principal directions) and eigenvalues (variance along each direction). The top k eigenvectors form a projection matrix W, and data is projected as Y = X·W. Standard implementations use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) rather than eigendecomposition directly, which is numerically more stable and efficient. The explained variance ratio for the k-th component is the percentage of total variance captured by that component, computed as λ_k / Σλ_i. Cumulative explained variance shows the proportion of total variance captured by the top k components. A scree plot shows eigenvalues (or explained variance) for each component; an elbow in this plot suggests the number of components to retain. Typically, components explaining 80-95% of total variance are retained, though application-specific requirements may differ.

### Feature Reconstruction and Loss Analysis

When projecting to lower dimensions, information is lost unless all variance is retained. The reconstruction error ||X - X_reconstructed||² measures information loss; perfectly retaining all variance means zero reconstruction error, while retaining only a fraction means non-zero error. The reconstruction error equals the sum of eigenvalues (variances) associated with discarded components. Therefore, minimizing retained components minimizes reconstruction error, directly reflecting our variance-maximization principle. For visualization purposes (k=2 or k=3), we accept significant reconstruction error in exchange for interpretable visualizations. For preprocessing steps in supervised learning, we select k to balance reconstruction error and computational efficiency; higher dimensionality better preserves information but increases downstream computation. Cross-validation can assess how dimensionality selection affects supervised learning performance.

### Limitations and Extensions

PCA identifies linear relationships and may miss nonlinear structure in data. Kernel PCA extends PCA to nonlinear dimensionality reduction by implicitly working in a high-dimensional kernel space. For data with highly non-Gaussian distributions, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) finds statistically independent components rather than maximum variance directions. PCA assumes continuous variables and can be affected by outliers due to the covariance matrix. Robust PCA variants use robust covariance estimators to handle outliers. For categorical variables, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) extends PCA logic. PCA whitening (normalizing by standard deviations) ensures all components have unit variance, which can be beneficial for downstream algorithms. Incremental PCA processes data in batches, enabling PCA on datasets too large to fit in memory. Despite limitations, PCA remains fundamental in unsupervised learning for visualization, denoising, and dimensionality reduction as a preprocessing step.
