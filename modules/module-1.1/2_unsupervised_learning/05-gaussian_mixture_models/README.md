# Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

## Fundamentals

GMM is a probabilistic clustering model that assumes data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. GMM provides soft assignments (probabilities) rather than hard cluster assignments, and naturally handles uncertainty and outliers. GMM is more flexible than K-Means and can model elliptical clusters. Maximum likelihood estimation with the EM algorithm makes GMM powerful for complex data distributions.

## Key Concepts

- **Mixture Components**: K Gaussian distributions
- **Soft Assignments**: Probability of belonging to each cluster
- **Expectation-Maximization**: Iterative optimization
- **Covariance Types**: Spherical, tied, diagonal, full
- **Model Selection**: BIC, AIC criteria

### Probabilistic Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) treat clustering as a probabilistic problem where data is assumed to come from a mixture of k Gaussian distributions. Each cluster is represented by a Gaussian with parameters (mean, covariance) and a mixing weight (proportion of data from that Gaussian). Unlike k-means which assigns points hard cluster membership, GMM provides soft assignments—a probability that each point belongs to each cluster. The likelihood function for GMM is p(X|θ) = Π Σ π_k·N(x_i|μ_k, Σ_k), where π_k are mixing weights, μ_k are means, and Σ_k are covariances. Maximum likelihood estimation of parameters is performed via Expectation-Maximization (EM), which iterates between computing expected cluster membership (E-step) and updating parameters (M-step). GMM provides a principled probabilistic framework for clustering, including uncertainty quantification through cluster membership probabilities.

### The Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is a general framework for maximum likelihood estimation with latent variables. In GMM context, cluster assignments are latent (unknown). The E-step computes the responsibility (posterior probability) that each point belongs to each cluster: γ(z_{ik}) = π_k·N(x_i|μ_k, Σ_k) / Σ_j π_j·N(x_i|μ_j, Σ_j). The M-step updates parameters: π_k ← 1/n·Σ γ(z_{ik}), μ_k ← Σ γ(z_{ik})·x_i / Σ γ(z_{ik}), and Σ_k is updated similarly. EM alternates between E and M steps with guaranteed monotonic increase in likelihood, converging to a local maximum. EM provides soft probabilistic assignments during and after training, contrasting with k-means' hard assignments. This probabilistic treatment allows expressing clustering uncertainty and using probability-based selection criteria.

### Model Selection and Covariance Constraints

Selecting the number of components (equivalent to selecting k) uses information criteria. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is BIC = -2 log L + p log n, balancing likelihood fit with model complexity (p is parameter count). Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) similarly balances fit and complexity with different penalties. Lower BIC/AIC indicates better models, so these metrics can be computed for different k values and the best k selected. The problem of GMM over-parameterization (unrestricted covariance matrices have O(k·d²) parameters) can be addressed by constraining covariance structure. Full covariance matrices allow Σ_k = [arbitrary symmetric positive-definite matrix] (most flexible). Diagonal covariance assumes independence between features within clusters. Spherical covariance assumes equal variance in all directions Σ_k = σ²_k·I. These constraints reduce parameters and regularize against overfitting.

### Advantages and Limitations

GMM advantages include probabilistic interpretation, soft cluster assignments enabling uncertainty quantification, and principled model selection through likelihood. GMM is well-suited for model-based clustering where underlying data generation matches Gaussian mixture assumptions. The soft assignments are useful for applications requiring confidence or where hard assignments are inappropriate. EM convergence guarantees local optima though not global optima, and multiple random initializations often improve results. However, GMM is sensitive to initialization and may converge to poor local optima. Computational complexity is O(k·d²·n·iterations), higher than k-means for complex covariance structures. GMM assumes Gaussian cluster shapes; non-Gaussian clusters may be poorly modeled. For very high-dimensional data, covariance estimation becomes unstable. Despite limitations, GMM provides a principled probabilistic framework valuable in applications where soft cluster assignments and likelihood-based model selection are important.
