# Q-Learning

## Fundamentals

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value (Q-value) of state-action pairs without requiring a model of the environment. The agent learns by taking actions, observing rewards, and updating Q-values iteratively. Q-Learning is off-policy (learning from actions different from the policy being followed) and is applicable to both discrete and continuous action spaces with function approximation.

## Key Concepts

- **Q-Value**: Expected cumulative future reward
- **Bellman Equation**: Recursive value update
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Epsilon-greedy strategy
- **Learning Rate and Discount Factor**: Convergence control
- **Off-Policy Learning**: Decoupled exploration and exploitation

### Markov Decision Processes and Q-Values

Q-learning operates within the framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which model sequential decision-making under uncertainty. An MDP consists of states S, actions A, transition probabilities P(s'|s, a), rewards R(s, a, s'), and a discount factor γ ∈ [0, 1]. The goal is to find an optimal policy π* that maximizes expected cumulative discounted reward. The Q-function Q(s, a) represents the expected cumulative reward from taking action a in state s and following the optimal policy thereafter: Q(s, a) = E[R(s, a, s') + γ max_{a'} Q(s', a')]. Q-values satisfy the Bellman optimality equation, providing the foundation for Q-learning. The optimal policy is determined greedily from Q-values: π*(s) = argmax_a Q(s, a). Q-learning directly estimates Q-values from experience without requiring knowledge of transition probabilities or rewards, making it model-free and practical.

### Off-Policy Learning and the Q-Learning Update Rule

Q-learning is off-policy, meaning it learns the optimal policy while following a different behavior policy for exploration. This flexibility allows improving exploration while learning optimal behavior. The Q-learning update rule is: Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α[R(s, a, s') + γ max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)], where α is the learning rate and the bracketed term is the temporal difference (TD) error. This update moves Q-values toward the Bellman target R + γ max Q(s', a'). The learning rate α ∈ (0, 1] balances between incorporating new information (high α) and stability (low α). Decreasing α over time creates robust convergence. The discount factor γ balances immediate and long-term rewards; γ near 1 prioritizes long-term rewards while γ near 0 prioritizes immediate rewards. Q-learning converges to the optimal Q* under the conditions of adequate exploration and decreasing learning rates.

### Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off and Strategies

During learning, agents must balance exploring unknown actions to discover reward opportunities versus exploiting known good actions. Pure exploitation quickly gets stuck in local optima; pure exploration wastes samples. ε-greedy strategies take random actions with probability ε and greedy actions otherwise. Decaying ε from high to low values provides initial exploration followed by exploitation convergence. Softmax/Boltzmann exploration selects actions with probability proportional to exp(Q(s, a)/τ), providing smooth probabilistic exploration. Temperature τ controls randomness; high τ approaches uniform random exploration while low τ approaches greedy selection. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) balances exploration and exploitation by selecting actions with highest uncertainty-adjusted Q-values. Optimistic initialization of Q-values encourages initial exploration. The choice of exploration strategy significantly impacts learning efficiency; sophisticated strategies substantially reduce sample complexity compared to simple ε-greedy.

### Convergence, Limitations, and Deep Q-Learning

Q-learning theoretically converges to the optimal Q* under mild conditions, but convergence in practice depends on proper hyperparameter settings and sufficient exploration. Q-learning faces challenges with large state spaces: the tabular representation requires O(|S||A|) memory and computation. For continuous states, function approximation (neural networks) approximates Q-values: Q(s, a; θ) ≈ Q(s, a). However, neural network approximation can destabilize learning due to non-stationarity of targets (network parameters change during learning). Deep Q-Networks (DQN) address this through experience replay (storing and sampling past transitions) and target networks (slowly updating copies of the main network). These techniques substantially improve convergence and sample efficiency. DQN achieved superhuman performance on Atari games, demonstrating Q-learning's power when combined with modern neural networks. Despite successes, Q-learning and its extensions remain sensitive to hyperparameters and may suffer from overestimation bias or divergence without careful tuning.
