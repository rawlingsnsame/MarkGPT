# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Fundamentals

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet effective instance-based learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the proximity of training samples to the query point. KNN is a lazy learning algorithm that stores training data and makes predictions at query time, making it inherently flexible for both classification and regression. Despite its simplicity, KNN can capture complex non-linear patterns and handles multi-class problems naturally. However, it requires careful distance metric selection and feature scaling, and its computational cost grows with dataset size. KNN is commonly used as a baseline algorithm and in cases where interpretability through similar examples is valuable.

## Key Concepts

- **Distance Metrics**: Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski
- **Value of K**: Determines neighborhood size
- **Distance Weighting**: Weighted vs. uniform voting
- **Lazy Learning**: No training phase

## Applications

- Image recognition
- Recommendation systems
- Medical diagnosis
- Anomaly detection
- Document classification

### Distance Metrics Beyond Euclidean

While Euclidean distance is most common, other metrics suit different data types. Manhattan distance (L1) |x-y| sum uses coordinate differences; it's often more robust to outliers. Chebyshev distance (L-infinity) max(|x-y|) uses maximum coordinate difference; useful for bounded spaces. For high-dimensional data, Euclidean distances become less meaningful (curse of dimensionality); Manhattan or Chebyshev sometimes perform better. For text, cosine similarity (angle between vectors) is standard; it ignores magnitude, focusing on direction. For categorical data, Hamming distance (number of differing coordinates) applies. Domain-specific distances exist: edit distance (Levenshtein) for strings, dynamic time warping for time series, geodesic distance for data on manifolds. Choosing metric requires domain knowledge: geometric intuition in Euclidean space doesn't apply in all domains. k-NN performance is sensitive to metric choice; trying multiple metrics via cross-validation is worthwhile. Custom distances can be plugged into scikit-learn's k-NN.

### KD-Trees and Ball-Trees for Efficiency

Brute-force k-NN searches through all training points; O(n) per query. For large n (1M+), this is slow. KD-trees (k-dimensional trees) and ball-trees recursively partition space hierarchically. Search via these structures is O(log n) on average, massively faster. However, trees' efficiency degrades in high dimensions (curse of dimensionality); for d > 20, brute-force sometimes outperforms tree search. Scikit-learn automatically selects: if n < 30 or d > 16, it uses brute-force; otherwise, KD-tree or ball-tree depending on metrics. For production systems requiring fast queries, building trees once and querying many times is efficient. Approximate nearest neighbor methods (locality-sensitive hashing, learned indices) further improve speed, trading accuracy for extreme speed. Understanding these data structures helps practitioners: for thousands of queries on large data, preprocessing via tree construction is worthwhile.
