# Module 1.1: Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Overview

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, divided into three major paradigms:

1. **Supervised Learning** - Learning from labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning** - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning** - Learning through interaction and reward signals

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following pre-defined rules, ML models learn patterns from data and use these patterns to make predictions or decisions.

Machine Learning has become fundamental to modern technology, powering applications from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles. Understanding the core concepts and algorithms is essential for any data scientist or AI engineer.

### Goals of This Module

This module aims to:
- Establish a strong foundation in machine learning theory and practice

9. **Neural Networks** - Deep learning for complex patterns
10. Plus additional variations and hybrid approaches

## Unsupervised Learning Paradigm

### Definition
Unsupervised learning involves finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Without target outputs to guide the learning process, these algorithms identify structure, relationships, and groupings within the data itself.

### When to Use

5. **Gaussian Mixture Models** - Probabilistic clustering
6. **Manifold Learning** - Non-linear dimensionality reduction

## Reinforcement Learning Paradigm

### Definition
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions through interaction with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for its actions and learns to maximize cumulative reward over time.

### When to Use
- You're dealing with sequential decision-making problems
- You have an environment or simulator to interact with
- You need to optimize a long-term strategy

## Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

### Why It Matters
Data quality and features are often more important than the algorithm choice. Organizations typically spend 60-80% of time on data preparation and feature engineering.

### Data Preparation Best Practices
- **Handle Missing Values**: Understand why data is missing (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
- **Detect Outliers**: Use statistical methods (IQR, Z-score) or domain knowledge
- **Normalize/Standardize**: Essential for distance-based algorithms
- **Handle Categorical Variables**: One-hot encoding, label encoding, or embeddings
- **Address Class Imbalance**: SMOTE, class weights, or threshold adjustment
- **Train-Test Splitting**: Stratified sampling preserves class distributions

### Feature Engineering Techniques
- **Polynomial Features**: Capture non-linear relationships
- **Interaction Features**: Combine related variables
- **Binning/Discretization**: Convert continuous to categorical
- **Scaling**: Normalize features to similar ranges
- **PCA/Feature Selection**: Reduce dimensionality
- **Domain-specific Features**: Leverage domain expertise

### Common Data Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Data Leakage**: Information from test set leaking into training
- **Temporal Leakage**: Using future information to predict the past
- **Class Imbalance**: Minority class being ignored in training
- **Outlier Sensitivity**: Extreme values distorting model behavior
- **Feature Scaling**: Forgetting to scale features before training
- **Missing Documentation**: Not recording preprocessing decisions

## Model Evaluation Metrics

### Evaluating Supervised Learning Models

**Classification Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions (use with balanced datasets)
- **Precision**: True positives / (true positives + false positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (true positives + false negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under receiver operating characteristic curve
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed breakdown of prediction types

**Regression Metrics**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared differences
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute differences
- **R-squared (R²)**: Proportion of variance explained
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Percentage error

### Evaluating Unsupervised Learning Models

**Clustering Metrics**
- **Silhouette Score**: Measure of cluster cohesion (-1 to 1)
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Ratio of within to between cluster distances
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Ratio of between to within dispersion
- **Inertia**: Sum of squared distances to nearest centroid

### Choosing the Right Metric
- Consider business objectives, not just mathematical metrics
- Understand class imbalance impact on metric selection
- Use multiple metrics for comprehensive evaluation
- Document why specific metrics were chosen

## Cross-Validation and Testing Strategies

### Why Cross-Validation Matters
Cross-validation provides more reliable performance estimates by using multiple train-test splits rather than a single split, which may not be representative of model performance.

### Cross-Validation Techniques
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Divide data into k equal parts, train k models
- **Stratified K-Fold**: Preserve class distribution in each fold
- **Time Series Split**: Respect temporal ordering in time-series data
- **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation**: Use one sample for testing, rest for training
- **Nested Cross-Validation**: Separate validation for hyperparameter tuning

### Proper Train-Test Split Strategy
- **Training Set** (60-70%): Used for model training
- **Validation Set** (10-15%): Used for hyperparameter tuning
- **Test Set** (15-30%): Final evaluation, touched only once
- **Temporal Ordering**: For time-series, split chronologically
- **Stratification**: Preserve class distributions in splits

### Avoiding Evaluation Pitfalls
- Never tune hyperparameters on test set
- Don't report metrics from training data as final performance
- Use random states for reproducibility
- Account for data leakage between sets
- Document your cross-validation strategy

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Understanding Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters are configuration settings chosen before training that control how the learning algorithm behaves. Unlike model parameters learned from data, hyperparameters define the learning process itself.

### Common Hyperparameter Tuning Methods
- **Grid Search**: Exhaustive search over specified parameter values
- **Random Search**: Random sampling of parameter space
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Probabilistic model-based search
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Evolution-inspired optimization
- **Hyperband**: Successive halving for faster tuning

### Hyperparameter Tuning Best Practices
- Start with default values and understand their impact
- Use domain knowledge to set reasonable ranges
- Tune hyperparameters using validation set, not test set
- Search coarse-to-fine for efficiency
- Parallelize search for faster computation
- Document optimal values for reproducibility
- Consider computational budget when choosing search strategy

### Common Hyperparameters by Algorithm
- **Tree-based**: tree depth, min samples split, number of trees
- **Linear Models**: regularization strength (C, alpha), solver type
- **SVM**: kernel type, C parameter, gamma
- **Neural Networks**: learning rate, batch size, number of layers
- **Clustering**: number of clusters, initialization method

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Training and Validation Mistakes
- **Mistake**: Hyperparameter tuning on test set
  - **Fix**: Use separate validation set for tuning, test set for final evaluation
- **Mistake**: Not scaling features before training
  - **Fix**: Normalize/standardize all numerical features consistently
- **Mistake**: Evaluating only on training data
  - **Fix**: Always evaluate on held-out test data

  - **Fix**: Carefully track temporal order and separate data splits
- **Mistake**: Ignoring class imbalance
  - **Fix**: Use stratified sampling, class weights, or resampling techniques
- **Mistake**: Duplicates in train and test sets
  - **Fix**: Check for duplicates and remove from one set before splitting
- **Mistake**: Using test set statistics for preprocessing
  - **Fix**: Fit normalization on training set, apply to test set

### Model Development Mistakes
- **Mistake**: Picking model complexity without evidence
  - **Fix**: Start simple, increase complexity only if needed
- **Mistake**: Ignoring the bias-variance tradeoff
  - **Fix**: Explicitly check for overfitting and underfitting
- **Mistake**: Not documenting the development process
  - **Fix**: Keep detailed records of experiments and decisions

### Interpretation Mistakes
- **Mistake**: Assuming correlation implies causation
  - **Fix**: Understand the difference; use proper statistical tests
- **Mistake**: Overgeneralizing from model performance
  - **Fix**: Test on diverse, representative data

## The Bias-Variance Tradeoff

### Understanding Bias and Variance

**Bias** refers to systematic errors from oversimplified assumptions in the model. High bias models underfit, failing to capture the underlying patterns in data.

**Variance** refers to sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. High variance models overfit, memorizing noise rather than learning patterns.

### Identifying Bias-Variance Issues

**High Bias (Underfitting)**
- Training error is high
- Validation error is also high
- Training and validation errors are similar
- Model is too simple for the problem

**High Variance (Overfitting)**
- Training error is low
- Validation error is much higher than training error
- Large gap between training and validation error
- Model is too complex for available data

### Strategies to Address Imbalance

**For Underfitting (High Bias)**
- Use more complex model architecture
- Add more features or polynomial features
- Reduce regularization strength
- Increase model training duration
- Collect more diverse data

**For Overfitting (High Variance)**
- Use simpler model architecture
- Add regularization (L1, L2, dropout)
- Collect more training data
- Perform feature selection
- Use early stopping
- Increase dropout rate for neural networks

### The Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Practice
The goal is to find the sweet spot where total error (bias + variance + irreducible error) is minimized. This often requires experimentation with different model complexities.
