# Module 1.1: Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Overview

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, divided into three major paradigms:

1. **Supervised Learning** - Learning from labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning** - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning** - Learning through interaction and reward signals

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following pre-defined rules, ML models learn patterns from data and use these patterns to make predictions or decisions.

Machine Learning has become fundamental to modern technology, powering applications from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles. Understanding the core concepts and algorithms is essential for any data scientist or AI engineer.

### Goals of This Module

This module aims to:
- Establish a strong foundation in machine learning theory and practice
- Develop practical skills in implementing ML algorithms
- Build intuition for choosing appropriate algorithms for different problems
- Create a bridge between theoretical understanding and real-world application
- Prepare you for advanced ML topics and specialized domains

## Module Structure

Each learning paradigm contains multiple algorithms with:
- **README.md** - Conceptual foundations and theory
- **exercises.md** - 10 hands-on exercises per algorithm
- **question.md** - Application questions for deep understanding

## Supervised Learning Paradigm

### Definition
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where each input has a corresponding correct output. The model learns the mapping between inputs and outputs, then applies this learned mapping to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### When to Use
- You have labeled training data
- You need to predict specific values or categories
- You have clear input-output relationships
- Accuracy on specific metrics is critical

### Key Algorithms Covered
1. **Linear Regression** - Predicting continuous values
2. **Logistic Regression** - Binary and multi-class classification
3. **Decision Trees** - Interpretable classification and regression
4. **Random Forests** - Ensemble method for improved accuracy
5. **Support Vector Machines** - Powerful classifier for complex boundaries
6. **Naive Bayes** - Fast probabilistic classifier
7. **K-Nearest Neighbors** - Instance-based learning
8. **Gradient Boosting** - Sequential ensemble method
9. **Neural Networks** - Deep learning for complex patterns
10. Plus additional variations and hybrid approaches

## Unsupervised Learning Paradigm

### Definition
Unsupervised learning involves finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Without target outputs to guide the learning process, these algorithms identify structure, relationships, and groupings within the data itself.

### When to Use
- You have unlabeled data
- You want to discover hidden patterns or structure
- You need to reduce dimensionality of high-dimensional data
- Customer segmentation or market analysis is required
- Exploratory data analysis is your first step

### Key Algorithms Covered
1. **K-Means Clustering** - Partitioning data into k clusters
2. **Hierarchical Clustering** - Building a hierarchy of clusters
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** - Dimensionality reduction
4. **DBSCAN** - Density-based clustering
5. **Gaussian Mixture Models** - Probabilistic clustering
6. **Manifold Learning** - Non-linear dimensionality reduction

## Reinforcement Learning Paradigm

### Definition
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions through interaction with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for its actions and learns to maximize cumulative reward over time.

### When to Use
- You're dealing with sequential decision-making problems
- You have an environment or simulator to interact with
- You need to optimize a long-term strategy
- Traditional supervised data isn't available
- Games, robotics, or control problems are involved

### Key Algorithms Covered
1. **Q-Learning** - Model-free temporal difference learning
2. **Policy Gradient Methods** - Direct policy optimization
3. **Actor-Critic** - Combining value and policy methods
4. **Deep Q-Networks** - Scaling Q-learning with deep neural networks
