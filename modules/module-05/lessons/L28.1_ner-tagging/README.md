# Named Entity Recognition and Tagging
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## NER Task Definition

NER identifies named entities in text.

Entity types include person, organization, location.

Entity boundaries must be precise.

Multi-word entities require coordinated predictions.

Nested entities complicate label structure.

Entity context provides classification signal.

Domain variation affects entity definitions.

## Sequence Labeling

BIO tagging represents entity boundaries.

BIOES tagging distinguishes entity endings.

IOBES tagging further refines boundaries.

CRF decoding ensures valid label sequences.

HMM captures label dependencies.

LSTM-CRF combines neural and structured learning.

Beam search finds high-probability sequences.
