# Tokenization Deep Dive: Understanding BPE

## Why Subword Tokenization?

Three levels of tokenization:
1. **Character-level**: Every character is a token
   - Pros: Small vocabulary (256 tokens)
   - Cons: Long sequences, hard to learn patterns
2. **Word-level**: Every word is a token
   - Pros: Compact sequences
   - Cons: Large vocabulary (10K-100K), OOV (out-of-vocabulary) substrings
3. **Subword-level** (BPE): Best of both worlds
   - Vocabulary: 5K-50K tokens
   - Learns common substrings as single tokens

## BPE Algorithm

```
Step 1: Initialize: Each character is a token
Step 2: Count bigram frequencies (adjacent token pairs)
Step 3: Merge the most frequent bigram
Step 4: Repeat steps 2-3 until vocab size reached
```

### Worked Example

Initial (character-level):
```
"dog", "cat", "dog"
→ d o g c a t d o g
```

Most frequent bigram: "o" + "g" (appears 2x as "og")

After merge 1:
```
d og c a t d og
```

Continue merging...

## Fertility: A Key Metric

**Fertility** = average tokens per word

Lower is better!

Example:
- Character-level on "beautiful": 9 tokens → fertility 1.0 (1 word, 9 tokens)
- Word-level on "beautiful": 1 token → fertility 1.0
- BPE (8K vocab) on "beautiful": 2-3 tokens → fertility ~1.3

Typical values:
- English KJV: 1.3-1.5
- Banso text: 1.4-1.8 (complex morphology)

## Banso Language Challenges

1. **Phonotactics**: Nso' has specific consonant clusters uncommon in English
2. **Affixation**: Rich prefix/suffix system (e.g., a-, ba-, -i, -a)
3. **Tone markers**: Optional but linguistically important
4. **Morphological complexity**: Single words can encode much information
