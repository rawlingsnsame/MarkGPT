# Word Embeddings and Representation Learning
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Embedding Fundamentals

Word embeddings map words to dense vectors.

Vector dimensions capture semantic properties.

Similar words have similar embeddings.

Embedding space enables mathematical operations.

Analogies solvable through vector arithmetic.

Dimensionality reduction preserves relationships.

Distributed representations improve generalization.

## Embedding Properties

Semantically similar words cluster in space.

Related concepts form coherent regions.

Direction captures semantic relationships.

Magnitude affects similarity metrics.

Vector operations reflect linguistic properties.

Additive compositionality enables phrase vectors.

Geometry of embedding space interpretable.

## Learning Embeddings

Embeddings learned from distributional context.

Surrounding words provide training signal.

Prediction tasks drive embedding learning.

Frequency weighting emphasizes common words.

Context window determines learned relationships.

Training objective shapes embedding properties.

Initialization affects convergence speed.

## Advanced Embedding Techniques

Retrofitting embeddings to external knowledge bases.

Cross-lingual embeddings enable multilingual transfer.

## Embedding Properties

### Compositionality

Can combine embeddings?
"new" + "york" ≈ "new york"
Sometimes works, sometimes not
Non-linear: Addition too simple
Better: Learn composition

### Polysemy (Multiple Meanings)

"bank" = financial or river
Single embedding loses info
Contextualized embeddings help
Or: Prototype + sense vectors
Hard problem
